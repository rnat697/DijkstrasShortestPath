# Dijkstra's Shortest Path
University individual assignment to implement Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm using Java and OOP concepts. (Object Oriented Programming course, 2021)
##### Author: Rachel Nataatmadja

I had to:
- Represent Graphs using object-oriented concepts.
- Implement common data structures like LinkedLists and Stacks.
- Implement unit testing with JUnit.
- Implement search operations on Graphs using algorithms such as Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS).
- Implement an algorithm for finding the shortest path in a graph using Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm.
- Perform OO design using the Model View Controller (MVC) design pattern
